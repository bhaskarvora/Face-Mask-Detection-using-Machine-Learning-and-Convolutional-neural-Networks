# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Convolutional-neural-Networks


Abstract

The spread of COVID-19 is increasingly worrying for everyone in the world. 
This virus can be affected from human to human through the droplets and 
airborne and is very deadly. According to the instruction from WHO, to 
reduce the spread of COVID-19, every people need to wear face mask, do 
social distancing, evade the crowd area and always maintain the immune 
system. However, we cannot have lockdown or avoid going outside till this 
corona situation ends as we need to adopt to this corona situation so our 
personal life doesn’t get affected. People have to go to their Job/Work and 
cannot keep sitting at home. Also, many experts have predicted that this 
situation of corona virus will likely shift to endemic from pandemic in India. 
Therefore, to protect each other, every person should wear the face mask 
properly when they are in outdoor. However, we cannot keep track of 
everyone wearing mask. So in this case, Automated Mask Detection system 
would help a lot, which would detect if person has worn a mask or not and 
alert him to wear if mask is not detected. 

The main objective of this project is to design a system which 
capturers user face and detects if mask if present or not. The most 
important part of the project is Mask Detection System which will be 
trained using neural networks. The project uses Python as the 
programming language which allows us to implement this system as 
Python contains libraries for data training which is required for the 
mask detection system to learn the difference between a person with 
mask and person without mask and provide accurate result. We will 
train the Mask Detection system with images of person with and 
without mask so using machine learning, it can discriminate between 
them. If a person without mask is detected then it will alarm that 
person to wear the mask. In this way, it helps in reducing the spread of 
Corona virus


Introduction 

Mask Detection system uses Computer Vision to check presence of mask on 
persons face. If mask is not detected then it alarms that person to wear the mask. 
The system Will be powered by PYTHON with its Deep learning libraires such 
as OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow which makes Mask Detection Possible.
Working :-

The Core Component of Mask Detection System is Mask Detection Module. 
All the logic of mask detection will be uploaded in the module. The 
Alarm/Bulb will also be connected to the system which will ring if mask is 
not detected. 
The Camera will capture image of person standing in front of it. The image 
will be passed further to Mask Detection Module which will detect a person 
face and using previous learned images will check if mask is present on 
person’s face or not. If mask is not found on person’s face, it will ring alarm 
or light up bulb as output. The system will works as follow :
